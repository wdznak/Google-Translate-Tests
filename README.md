# GTests
C++/Qt5 app for creating tests from Google Translate xlsx(MS Excel)files.

You can download the list of saved words from your Google Translate account, and create simple tests. The app will automatically create tests but you can also create your own and separate them by topics of your choice. 

Database used in a project is *[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)*. 
Xlsx files are handled by *[Qt Xlsx module](https://github.com/wdznak/SEService)*
